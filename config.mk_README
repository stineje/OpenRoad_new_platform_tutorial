In the config.mk file there are several environment variables that need to be changed to fit the specific platform that is being used. Specifically the paths for the TECH_LEF, SC_LEF, LIB_FILES, GDS_FILES, FILL_CELLS, HOLD_BEF_CELLS, and the TIEHI and TIELO cells need to be set. There are more lines in the config file that need the names and paths changed so it is recommended that it is read through completely and changed where needed.
There are also options inside that can be changed to fit the requirements of the technology such as MAX_WIRE_LENGTH, PLACE_DENSITY, etc.

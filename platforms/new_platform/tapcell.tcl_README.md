One should use the equivalent file from the sample platform as an example.
The file in question has the following format:


tapcell \
  -endcap_cpp "numerical_value_goes_here" \
  -distance numerical_value_goes_here \
  -tapcell_master "tap_cell" \
  -endcap_master "endcap_cell"

The names of the tap_cell and endcap_cell must be obtained from the original platform.
Similarly, the spacing rules must be obtained from the original platformâ€™s rule-set.

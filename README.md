# Briging up a new platform in OpenROAD

This repository documents the methodology required to bring up a new platform to be used with OpenROAD.

OpenROAD platforms are defined by a number of config and tech files placed inside a "platforms" folder.
Such a "platforms" folder is included in this repository.
Inside "platforms" lie two folders:
 * sample\_platform is a sample platform, directly from the OpenROAD organization
 * new\_platform is a collection of README files meant to facilitate bringing up a new platform

Built by the team at Oklahoma State University with help from others at the University of California San Diego.
